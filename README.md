# House-Price-Prediction
This projects compares and deploys data mining techniques to predict house price using available kaggle housing dataset.

On real estate data, many data mining techniques for house pricing, such as random forest, gradient boosting, and linear regressor, decision tree have been used. These prediction models were created using test sets of various sizes. The measurement procedures that were made use of the metrics Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Random Forest produced the greatest results with the accuracy of 86%.
